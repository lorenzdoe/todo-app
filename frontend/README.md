# Frontend for TODO App

This is the frontend for a TODO app built using Vue.js. The app is designed to connect to a backend server running at `localhost:3000`. If you wish to connect to a different backend server, you can modify the source code accordingly.
The corresponding file is `api.js` in the `src` folder.

## Recommended IDE Setup

We recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) extension (and disabling Vetur) along with the [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) for the best development experience.

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development
